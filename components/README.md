A react native application utilitzing gifted-chat and Google Firebase to offer a real-time chat experience on iOS and Android.
## Getting started
## Setting Up a React Native Project

#### Setting Up Expo and Your Development Environment
--you need to install NOde.js, and  the Expo CLI in your terminal with this command:

`
npm install expo-cli --global
`

-not forget to download the Expo app on your mobile device, so that you can run the app directly from the Expo app.
##### Expo account 
 Head over to the Expo signup page [Expo sign-up page](https://expo.io/signup)

 #### Setting Up an Emulator and Simulator
##### Setting up a simulator for iOS
In order for the iOS simulator to run this app, [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/ "Xcode") needs to be installed. After installing XCode, open it up and head over to "Preferences." From there, click "Components" and install a simulator from the list. Open the simulator, start your Expo project, and click "Run on iOS simulator" or simply type "i" in the Expo CLI.

##### Setting up an emulator for Android
To set up Android Emulator, you first need to download and install [Android Studio](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v32.0.0/workflow/android-studio-emulator/ "Android Studio"). To do this, follow the on-screen installation instructions and make sure you **don't** untick the "Android Virtual Device" option in the installation dialog.

After the installation is complete, start Android Studio, click "Configure" and go to Settings -> Appearance & Behaviour -> System Settings -> Android SDK. Click the "SDK Tools" tab and check that you have "Android SDK Build-Tools" installed. If your "Android SDK Build-Tools" aren't installed, click on the "Android SDK Build-Tools‚Äù row, then download the latest version by clicking on the download symbol that appears next to it.

## required Libraries
To install all dependencies you can run:

 `npm i --save @react-native-community/async-storage @react-native-community/masked-view @react-native-community/netinfo @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack babel-preset-env better-docs expo expo-font expo-image-picker expo-location expo-permissions expo-updates firebase fsevents prop-types react react-dom react-google-maps react-native react-native-gesture-handler react-native-gifted-chat react-native-keyboard-spacer react-native-maps react-native-parsed-text react-native-reanimated react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens react-native-svg react-native-web react-native-web-maps react-navigaion react-navigation-stack`
